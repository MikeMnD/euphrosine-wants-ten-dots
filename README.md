## (Old) Concept

It is an autorun platform game where you are a running ladybug with one digit on your back (1 to 9). You run automatically but can change direction(left or right) by pressing `d` or jump by pressing `w`. (You can remap these keys).

There are other insects that are obstacles. They also have a digit on them (1 to 9). If you hit them their number is added to your number. The ladybug gets the resulting number. If that number is larger then 10 then 10 is substracted from it. Resulting in one digit. For example 7 + 6 = 13 - 10 = 3. If the result of the collision is exactly 10: then it is taboo and the game is over.

You can score points by overflowing the number 10. You then get the amount above 10 as points.

There are 9 different insects with different abilities:

- 1: static
- 2: flying around random
- 3: bouncing around random
- 4: rising and moving right on ceiling
- 5: rising and moving left on ceiling
- 6: rising and changing direction
- 7: dropping a moving left ground
- 8: dropping a moving right ground
- 9: dropping and changing direction on collision

Some insects collide, some pass each other

## Simpler Concept

You play as the ladybug Euphrosine. That likes dice and wants to collect their dots. You can run, jump, climb and float.
