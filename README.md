### Briefing

A game for the [10th Anniversary] â˜…  Kongregate Game Jam

Theme: `The Number 10`

Game Jam Link: http://www.kongregate.com/forums/1/topics/673084

Optional modifiers

Modifier #1 - No Violence

Modifier #2 - Mouth Sounds

Modifier #3 - Two Buttons

Bonus Modifier - This Vine

I only used the No Violence modifier.

The game had to be made in `7 days`. But after the jam i fixed some bugs and added some extra features like support for touch devices and gamepads.

### Simple Final Concept

You play as the ladybug Euphrosine. She can run, jump, climb and float.

Euphrosine likes dice and wants to collect their dots. When she catches a dice, a dot will appear on her back. The game ends when she collected 10 dots.
